# Stock-Price-Prediction
In this application we will predict the future closing prices of the stocks by plotting a graph. The volatile nature of stocks makes it nearly impossible to predict the exact stock values but trends can be predicted using technical analysis which is what I am using in this application. Though these values might not be exact but these can help stock brokers during prediction. 
Here you can check the stock prices of already existing companies from National Stock Exchange or you can upload your company's historical data .
